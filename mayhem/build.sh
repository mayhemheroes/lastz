# mayhem/build.sh — build the LASTZ fuzz target + the project's own test suite.
#
# Runs inside the commit image (mayhem/Dockerfile) as `mayhem` in /mayhem. The base image
# (ghcr.io/mayhemheroes/base) exports the build contract — CC/CXX, SANITIZER_FLAGS (ASan+UBSan,
# halting), DEBUG_FLAGS (DWARF<4), LIB_FUZZING_ENGINE, SRC=/mayhem.
#
# TWO independent builds:
#   1) FUZZ target — LASTZ built with $SANITIZER_FLAGS + $DEBUG_FLAGS so the fuzzed code itself is
#      instrumented and carries DWARF<4. The stock `lastz` CLI is a natural-crash file-input driver,
#      so the sanitized binary doubles as the standalone reproducer (no libFuzzer runtime to strip).
#      Installed at /mayhem/mayhem/lastz/lastz (the Mayhemfile cmd).
#   2) TEST suite — LASTZ (lastz + lastz_D) built with NORMAL flags (no sanitizer) left in src/ so
#      mayhem/test.sh only RUNS the upstream `make test`/`make base_tests` recipes, never compiles.
#
# Additive: the upstream Makefiles are NOT edited. LASTZ's src/Makefile hardcodes `CC=gcc`, bakes
# `-Werror` into CFLAGS, and offers no post-CFLAGS hook — so we drive it through a small CC wrapper
# (generated here, under /tmp) that APPENDS our flags (and -Wno-error) AFTER the Makefile's flags,
# guaranteeing they win without touching a tracked file.

# fix for 0-edge CLI targets — we compile it with afl-clang-fast (AFL_* coverage) instead of relying
# on binary-only tracing. afl-clang-fast forwards $SANITIZER_FLAGS to clang, so ASan+UBSan stay on.

# Narrow UBSan relax for the FUZZ build only (ASan + the rest of halting UBSan stay ON): LASTZ's
# binary-format reader read_4_little() (src/sequences.c:9228) builds a u32 as `seq_getc()<<24`, and
# any input byte >=128 makes that promoted-int left shift overflow — benign (the value is stored in
# a u32), but with halting UBSan it aborts on ~every malformed/binary-magic input. That flood makes
# the fork/exec target "crash on everything" so Mayhem never establishes coverage (0 edges, "Run
# Failed"). Relax ONLY the `shift` check, exactly as PORTING.md prescribes (cf. swftools). Applied
# after $SANITIZER_FLAGS so the -fno-sanitize wins; empty SANITIZER_FLAGS (off-switch) => empty relax.

# --- __asan_default_options object: baked into the fuzz binary on its LINK step -------------------

# hook object here and force-inject it into the final link (the link recipe is `CC LDFLAGS objs -lm
# -o lastz`, no -c). This bakes detect_leaks=0 without touching a tracked Makefile/source.
